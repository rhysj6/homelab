# What is being used?
For secret management I currently am opting to use [Infisical](https://infisical.com) as it has very good support for both kubernetes and terraform.

# How is it being hosted
Currently hosted on my Docker VM but will ideally be moved to redcliff once I have reset the cluster with what's im this repo. Because it's current deployment is temporary, I want to use terraform to configure it as much as possible
