# Ansible
I use Ansible to automate the configuration and updating of servers in my homelab. Ansible is a powerful configuration management tool that allows me to define the desired state of my servers and then apply that state to the servers. This makes it easy to keep my servers up to date and ensure that they are configured correctly.

Ansible is one of my key ways to reach my goal of automating the day to day running of my homelab. I use Ansible to automate the initial configuration of servers, as well as to automate the updating of servers.

Each Ansible playbook will have a README.md file that describes what the playbook does.
